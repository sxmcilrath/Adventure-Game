-	Properties
-	-	Sign | (pre tree climb) "Hello there young fellow. You must be brave to enter the treacherous
				'Ye Olde Tutorial' forest, very brave indeed. Before you stands a tall
				tree. Go up and observe well, when you are done, tell me what you see.
				Or don't, if you don't feel like it."
			 | (post tree climb, no good look) "What did you see? What!? You didn't even look around?
			 	Get back up there and let me properly tutorial you!"
			 | (post tree climb, good look) "What did you see? A dog? Of course! It is all
			 	so clear now. Go find that little pupper and give it a good pet. A belly rub is also
			 	recommended. Why? Believe me, it will all become clear to you in time."
