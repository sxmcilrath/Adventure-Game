				+ " Long ago, three friends entered these woods. Past it they found a castle built of ice, completely deserted, barring a lonesome dog. Yet there were many "
				+ " who wished to bring harm to the dog and so they decided to enchant the path they came from. To do so, the first friend left to grab the spells. The second friend "
				+ " was always right, so they planned out the icantations. The last friend went forward to prepare the magic signs. And finally, when the enchanting was done they realized"
				+ " they had no idea how to get through the forest and so they never went back. ";
